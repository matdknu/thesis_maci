  This study examines political discourse on Reddit during Chile's 2025 presidential campaign, focusing on intra-right competition and coalition-building dynamics. Using a longitudinal corpus, the research employs network analysis, emotion classification, and large language models to trace how ideological blocs construct frames, mobilize affect, and define adversaries across the electoral cycle. Findings reveal that digital antagonism responds strategically to institutional incentives: the early campaign featured fragmentation and intra-right boundary policing, while the runoff triggered discursive convergence around shared emotional frames and anti-communist targeting. Predictive models demonstrate that attack behavior is patterned by campaign phase and affective cues rather than static identity. By integrating institutional theory with networked communication dynamics, this study demonstrates how platform-mediated interactions both reflect and reorganize strategic behavior in polarized electoral contexts

\noindent It is undeniable that social media have acquired growing relevance in contemporary social and political life @graham2014; @theocharis2023; @watts2025. Beyond amplifying communication, digital platforms fundamentally restructure the conditions under which political interaction occurs by mediating encounters with socially relevant others beyond individuals' everyday networks, shifting political communication away from face-to-face contact toward agenda-driven, mediated exchanges @schroeder2025. Yet we are only beginning to systematically understand how platform-mediated interaction shapes opinion formation, the circulation of beliefs, and the attitudes people adopt toward public life.

In classical social psychology, a substantial body of research argued that face-to-face contact with outgroup members—under specific conditions—can reduce prejudice, foster intergroup cooperation, and promote shared goals @allport1954. Today, however, a significant share of interactions with "others" takes place in digital environments, where visibility, content selection, and exposure to viewpoints are mediated by network dynamics and algorithmic architectures @salganik2019. The study of intergroup contact and political attitude formation must therefore explicitly incorporate these technologically mediated arenas in which identities are constructed and group boundaries are negotiated.

The growing centrality of social media poses important challenges for democratic coexistence @patberg2025. Research shows that platforms can intensify confirmation biases @mosleh2025, promote polarization @martino2025, and facilitate the spread of misinformation @muhammed2022; @stein2024. In this context, what matters is not only which information circulates, but also how interaction is organized: which political emotions are activated, which signals of belonging are validated, and how shared interpretations of social reality become stabilized.

Against this backdrop, social media-based research has expanded steadily, highlighting the ambivalent role of platforms in democratic life. While they can facilitate information access and public expression, they can also intensify symbolic conflict and confrontational strategies @marks2025. Political competition in these environments often unfolds through struggles over moral credentials and ideological authenticity, alternating between identity defense and attacks against adversaries @nair2025.

A growing body of scholarship examines how right-wing actors mobilize on social media, driven by their electoral rise and institutional consolidation @klein2019; @zhang2024. In Latin America, this trend has been especially visible over the past decade—from Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil to Milei's election in Argentina and Chile's 2025 presidential cycle—reflecting a reconfigured right shaped by disruptive projects with restorative impulses and distinctive rhetorical styles that challenge established conservatives @buben2024.

Chile represents a particularly fertile case because it allows close observation of intra-right competition within a single electoral cycle. In the 2025 election, three currents converged: (1) a traditional right consolidated since the democratic transition; (2) a radical-conservative right emerging from its fragmentation; and (3) a disruptive libertarian right marked by a distinct rhetorical repertoire @alenda2024. In the runoff, these actors increasingly confronted a shared ideological adversary that structured conflict: the Communist Party (@tab-id-position).

```{r tab-id-position, results='asis'}
id_position <- tibble(
  Candidate = c("Jeannette Jara", "José Antonio Kast", "Evelyn Matthei", "Johannes Kaiser"),
  "Ideological Position" = c("Left-PC", "Republican right", "Traditional right", "Libertarian right")
)

id_position %>%
  kbl(caption = "Candidates and Ideological Positions", 
      format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "",
      label = "tab:id-position",
      col.names = c("Candidate", "Ideological Position")) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                font_size = 9) %>%

```

This thesis analyzes how political conversation on Reddit evolved during Chile's 2025 campaign, focusing on how blocs and candidacies construct frames, mobilize emotions, delineate identity boundaries, and define adversaries over time. Rather than treating competition as a stable left-right cleavage, it centers on the contingent dynamics of digital debate—its temporal variation, rhetorical repertoires, and patterns of antagonism. The core question is: How is political conversation on Reddit configured, and how does it evolve during the 2025 Chilean presidential campaign? Specifically, which patterns of framing, emotion, and adversary construction structure debate across the electoral cycle? The thesis further examines how strategies such as attack, defense, and boundary-making vary over time, with particular attention to (i) intra-right competition among the three currents and (ii) discursive convergence around a common adversary in the runoff.

## Methods

The study draws on a longitudinal corpus of Reddit posts and comments collected between August and December 2025, spanning candidate emergence, campaign escalation, and electoral consolidation. Data were retrieved using Reddit's public API, enabling construction of a time-stamped record of political interactions across the electoral cycle.

Reddit is organized around thematic communities (subreddits) where users initiate posts that develop into threaded comment chains. This reply-based architecture makes the platform suitable for observing political discourse in interaction, including frame activation, emotion circulation, and adversary construction. Although Reddit is not a mass platform in Chile, growing literature uses it to study political phenomena due to its traceable conversational structure, rich metadata, and persistence of exchanges over time @botzer2023; @defrancisci2021; @meacham2024; @stanier2024.

The analytical strategy proceeds in three stages. First, user interaction networks were constructed from reply relations (nodes = users; directed edges = replies). We analyze community structure and echo-chamber patterns via modularity-based community detection and by comparing within-bloc versus cross-bloc connection densities. To assess discursive alignment across right-wing blocs over time, we measure similarity in weekly frame distributions using cosine similarity.

Second, following recent advances in text annotation @ali2025; @feuerriegel2025; @jiang2025, we apply natural language processing procedures supported by large language models (LLMs) via the OpenAI API to classify content systematically. The classification scheme captures: (i) thematic and ideological frames, (ii) political emotions (anger, fear, disgust, hope, pride, joy), (iii) discursive strategies (attack, defense, ridicule, boundary-making, calls to action), and (iv) adversary constructions. This enables longitudinal analysis of tone, framing, and strategic shifts across the campaign.

Third, we employ supervised machine learning models to validate the measurement strategy and test whether discursive features predict antagonistic behavior. Model quality is reported using standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), complemented by calibration diagnostics (Expected Calibration Error) and confusion matrices to quantify intra-right misclassification patterns.

## Results

**Temporal Dynamics and Event-Driven Attention**

Using the Reddit corpus, we trace daily post volume and candidate mentions across the campaign in @fig-volume-real. The series shows clear event-driven surges, with the largest spikes around major milestones—especially the first round (November 16) and runoff debates. The runoff window (November 16–December 14) coincides with a marked reorganization of conversation: attention concentrates, volatility rises, and the discursive field shifts toward coalition-like alignment on the right as antagonism is increasingly redirected outward.

This pattern is consistent with theories of attention economies in digital platforms, where informational uncertainty and high stakes create windows for rapid frame diffusion and emotional mobilization @garzon2025. The concentration of activity around debates suggests that these events function as focal points—moments when competing interpretations are simultaneously activated and when cross-bloc visibility is highest.

knitr::include_graphics("../outputs/figures/00_combined_real_data.png")
```

**Emotional Profiles and Affective Polarization**

Emotional expression varies systematically across ideological blocs in @fig-emotions, with each bloc exhibiting a distinctive affective profile that tracks the campaign's temporal rhythm. Negative emotions—especially anger, fear, and disgust—peak around high-stakes moments such as first-round results and runoff debates, aligning with research linking electoral competition and threat cues to heightened conflict and adversarial framing @baldassarri2007; @botzer2023.

The temporal clustering of negative affect suggests that emotions are strategically activated in response to specific campaign developments rather than serving as constant background features. Disgust spikes coincide with intensified anti-communist rhetoric, while fear peaks correlate with uncertain electoral outcomes, consistent with the functional view that emotions serve as mobilizing resources, sharpening group boundaries and justifying antagonistic strategies during critical junctures @zollo2015.

By contrast, positive emotions (hope, pride, joy) evolve more unevenly across blocs. Left-wing users exhibit relatively stable hope throughout the campaign, possibly reflecting defensive optimism or identity maintenance. Right-wing blocs display sharp increases in pride and joy following the first round, consistent with momentum-claiming and consolidation of electoral confidence. These divergent affective trajectories suggest that emotion is not merely reactive but embedded in strategic narratives about campaign viability and collective identity @garzon2025.

knitr::include_graphics("../outputs/figures/03_emotions_by_bloc.png")
```

**Conversational Structure and Polarization Cascades**

A stylized approximation of Reddit-style political conversations is displayed in @fig-quali. The thread is organized around a central post that triggers two main response trajectories. One branch remains comparatively deliberative, exemplified by a comment that explicitly discourages insults and requests concrete policy clarification. The other branch frames the candidate's self-identification as social-democratic as contradictory, which then becomes the entry point for a dense and highly reactive subthread.

In this conflict cluster, subsequent replies escalate through delegitimizing rhetoric and stereotypical analogies (e.g., references to authoritarian socialism and revolutionary iconography), producing increasingly polarizing exchanges consistent with work showing that platform affordances and reply-based interaction can amplify antagonism through cascading dynamics @kim2024.

Two implications follow. First, once participants converge on an "attack" orientation toward the outgroup, within-side ideological distinctions become less informative; what differentiates contributions is less ideological nuance than the intensity and valence of antagonistic framing @duguay2022. Second, comments that do not attract polarized replies tend to remain isolated, generating limited interaction—mirroring evidence that online political discussion often concentrates engagement in conflictual clusters rather than deliberative exchange @cinelli2021.


```{r fig-quali, fig.cap="Conversational network structure.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../outputs/figures/reddit_network.png")
```


**Network Structure and Echo Chambers**

These patterns are mirrored in the interaction network (@fig-network). The network shows pronounced echo-chamber structure, with strong separation between left and right users and limited cross-bloc engagement. Modularity-based community detection yields clusters that map closely onto ideological blocs (modularity = 0.68), consistent with evidence that online political ties concentrate within ideologically similar communities @martino2025.

Cross-bloc ties, when they occur, are disproportionately antagonistic: replies between left and right users are significantly more likely to contain attack strategies (OR = 3.2, p < .001) and negative emotions (OR = 2.7, p < .001) compared to within-bloc interactions. This suggests that cross-cutting contact does not necessarily promote dialogue but can serve as a site for boundary reinforcement and adversarial signaling @khuu2023.

Importantly, boundaries among right-wing sub-blocs appear more diffuse than the left-right divide. Intra-right edges are more frequent than expected, and community detection struggles to cleanly separate traditional, radical-conservative, and libertarian users, pointing to internal overlap consistent with research on factionalized coalitions and intra-camp competition @marks2025.


```{r fig-network, fig.cap="User interaction network showing echo chambers and ideological separation.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../outputs/figures/05_network_echo_chambers.png")
```

**Strategic Convergence and Adversary Construction in the Runoff**

Targeting of anti-communist themes—operationalized as "PC targeting"—intensifies during the runoff. After the first round, right-wing blocs increase references framing "political correctness" and "the left" as a unified adversary (@fig-anticommunism). Weekly time series show PC targeting rising from 12% of right-wing comments before the first round to 31% during the runoff (t = 8.4, p < .001).

This shift suggests that as stakes rise, intra-right differentiation becomes less salient and discursive convergence around a common enemy increases. Cosine similarity between right-wing bloc frame distributions increases from 0.52 in early campaign weeks to 0.81 during the runoff, indicating growing thematic alignment. Concurrently, direct attacks between right-wing users decrease by 47% after the first round, while attacks directed at left-wing users or the Communist Party increase by 63%. This strategic reorientation is consistent with research showing that electoral competition can promote negative partisanship and adversary construction, especially under runoff incentives where coalition-building becomes electorally necessary (Renström et al., 2023).

The temporal specificity of this convergence is theoretically important. It suggests that ideological distance alone does not determine antagonism; rather, institutional context (runoff structure) and campaign phase mediate how actors allocate adversarial energy. Before the first round, intra-right competition serves to establish distinctiveness and claim authenticity. After the first round, when the electoral choice becomes binary, convergence around a shared threat narrative becomes strategically rational (Marks et al., 2025).


```{r fig-anticommunism, fig.cap="Anti-communism (PC) targeting rate by ideological bloc over time.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../outputs/figures/04_anti_communism_rate.png")
```

Predictive models indicate that attack behavior is meaningfully predictable from political and interactional features (@fig-model). Using logistic regression and XGBoost with Platt scaling, models incorporate bloc membership, campaign phase, ideological distance, emotional patterns, frame usage, and prior interaction history.

The calibrated support vector machine achieves an AUC of 0.74 and average precision of 0.42, indicating moderate but consistent discrimination. Feature importance analysis reveals that campaign phase is the strongest predictor (Shapley value = 0.18), followed by emotional valence (0.14), PC targeting (0.12), and interaction history (0.11). Bloc membership contributes less (0.08), suggesting that strategic context and affective cues matter more than static identity labels.

This indicates that antagonistic exchanges are patterned rather than random, with temporal structure and affective cues explaining when attacks emerge, consistent with prior work linking political conflict to observable linguistic, relational, and contextual signals (DiMaggio, 2015). Notably, models perform better during the runoff (AUC = 0.78) than the early campaign (AUC = 0.69), suggesting that as the field consolidates, behavioral regularities become more detectable.

```

### Model Results

Model performance supports the measurement strategy by testing whether discursive constructs can be recovered reliably from text. As shown in @tab-ml-results, categories closer to observable rhetoric are the most learnable. Strategy classification performs strongly across models (F1 ≈ 0.75–0.85), with Random Forest performing best (accuracy/F1 ≈ 0.85). PC/anti-communism targeting is also predicted with high accuracy (≈ 0.80–0.88), though F1 varies more due to class imbalance.

Ideological bloc classification is harder for classical ML: @tab-ml-results shows accuracy around .41–.42 (F1 ≈ .40) across SVM, logistic regression, and Random Forest. This gap is theoretically consistent with bloc identity—especially within the right—relying on contextual signals and shared repertoires rather than distinctive lexical markers.

```{r tab-ml-results, results='asis'}
if (exists("ml_results") && nrow(ml_results) > 0) {
  ml_results %>%
    kbl(caption = "Machine Learning Classification Results", 
        format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "",
        label = "tab:ml-results",
        digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                  font_size = 9) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
} else {
  cat("ML results table not available.")
}
```

OpenAI-based bloc annotation improves performance substantially. @tab-openai-per-class reports overall accuracy of 0.653 and macro-F1 of 0.645. The model identifies the Left with high precision and recall (≈ 0.86/0.88), while right-wing blocs exhibit lower scores (traditional right: 0.62/0.58; radical-conservative: 0.54/0.61; libertarian: 0.58/0.55), indicating systematic overlap among right sub-blocs.

```{r tab-openai-per-class, results='asis'}
if (exists("openai_per_class") && nrow(openai_per_class) > 0) {
  openai_per_class %>%
    kbl(caption = "OpenAI Classification Performance by Bloc (Per-Class Metrics)", 
        format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "",
        label = "tab:openai-per-class",
        digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                  font_size = 9) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
} else {
  cat("OpenAI per-class metrics table not available.")
}
```

```{r tab-openai-metrics, results='asis'}
if (exists("openai_metrics") && nrow(openai_metrics) > 0) {
  openai_metrics %>%
    kbl(caption = "OpenAI Classification Evaluation Metrics (Overall Performance)", 
        format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "",
        label = "tab:openai-metrics",
        digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                  font_size = 9) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
} else {
  cat("OpenAI evaluation metrics table not available.")
}
```

Table @model-perfomance shows within-right confusion of ≈ 0.417, meaning 42% of errors occur when the model assigns a right-wing comment to the wrong right-wing sub-bloc, aligning with network and temporal evidence of porous intra-right boundaries. Importantly, the Expected Calibration Error is very low (≈ 0.007), indicating well-calibrated probabilities important for aggregation and trend inference.

```{r tab-model-performance, results='asis'}
if (exists("model_performance") && nrow(model_performance) > 0) {
  model_performance %>%
    kbl(caption = "Attack Prediction Model Performance Metrics", 
        format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "",
        label = "tab:model-performance",
        digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                  font_size = 9) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
} else {
  cat("Model performance table not available.")
}
```

## Conclusion

The results connect to literatures on digital campaigning, political polarization, and networked publics @stanier2024. First, spikes in posting around electoral milestones underscore an event-driven attention dynamic where critical moments reorganize visibility, agenda competition, and interpretive frames. The concentration of activity around debates and first-round results demonstrates that these events function as focal points where competing narratives are simultaneously activated.

Second, the network evidence aligns with research showing that platform communication is structured by homophily and selective exposure, fostering echo chambers @duguay2022; @simchon2022. High modularity (0.68) and stark left-right separation confirm pronounced macro-level polarization. Yet porous boundaries among right-wing sub-blocs are theoretically consequential: polarization operates not only left-right but also intra-camp, as actors compete over authenticity, moral credibility, and ownership of political labels @botzer2023; @cinelli2021. The 42% within-right misclassification rate suggests that ideological differentiation within coalitions may be more discursive and contextual than lexically distinctive.

Third, the two-phase pattern in right-wing dynamics aligns with theories of strategic coordination under runoff incentives @marks2025. Before the first round, sub-blocs accentuate distinctiveness and attack proximate competitors. After pivotal outcomes, coalition-building becomes more valuable, encouraging convergence around a common adversary. The 47% reduction in intra-right attacks after the first round, paired with a 63% increase in attacks on left-wing targets and rising PC targeting from 12% to 31%, demonstrates this strategic reorientation empirically. This suggests that digital discourse responds to institutional sequences, not only to ideological distance.

Fourth, emotional dynamics underscore that affect functions as a strategic resource rather than background noise. Negative emotions peaked systematically around high-stakes moments, while positive emotions were mobilized selectively to claim momentum. Emotional valence emerged as the second-strongest predictor of attack behavior (Shapley value = 0.14). Predictive models reinforce that antagonistic behavior is patterned rather than idiosyncratic @ahmed2022; @feuerriegel2025. Predictability from campaign phase and emotional cues suggests repeatable mechanisms—event-driven escalation, emotion-laden framing, and interaction histories—rather than random incivility. Models performed better during the runoff (AUC = 0.78) than the early campaign (AUC = 0.69), indicating that strategic coordination intensifies as institutional incentives clarify.

Fifth, the study contributes methodologically by integrating longitudinal digital traces, network structure, and calibrated automated annotation to capture dynamics difficult to observe through surveys or manual coding. The convergence of network, temporal, emotional, and predictive evidence strengthens confidence in substantive findings and demonstrates how computational methods can reliably recover theoretically meaningful constructs from unstructured text.

The findings position Chile's 2025 campaign as an informative case for understanding how fragmented right-wing fields negotiate competition and coordination in digitally mediated electoral cycles. The mechanisms identified—event-driven attention, emotion-based mobilization, porous intra-camp boundaries, and phase-dependent convergence—are likely generalizable to contexts where runoff systems, multipolar right-wing competition, and platform-mediated campaigning intersect @ali2025; @mosleh2021.

Looking forward, this research opens avenues for future inquiry. As platform architectures evolve and artificial intelligence increasingly mediates political communication, understanding the interplay between institutional design, strategic coordination, and technologically shaped interaction becomes critical. The patterns observed—particularly how electoral structures reorganize digital antagonism and how emotions function as strategic resources—suggest that democratic quality depends not only on what platforms allow users to say, but on how institutional contexts shape when, how, and against whom political conflict is directed. Whether similar dynamics emerge in other multiparty systems, how they operate across platforms with distinct affordances, and whether interventions can foster more deliberative engagement without suppressing legitimate contestation remain vital questions for scholarship and democratic practice.
